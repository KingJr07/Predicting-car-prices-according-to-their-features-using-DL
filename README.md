**Predicting Car Prices according to their Features using Deep Learning**

This project uses deep learning techniques to build a model that predicts the price of a car based on its features.

**Features:**

* Preprocess and clean car data.
* Train different deep learning models for regression (e.g., Multi-layer Perceptron, Convolutional Neural Network).
* Evaluate the performance of each model using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.
* Visualize the relationship between car features and predicted prices.

**Requirements:**

* Python 3.x
* TensorFlow or PyTorch library
* NumPy library
* Pandas library
* Scikit-learn library (optional)

**Installation:**

1. Clone this repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/bard/car_price_prediction.git
```
2. Install the required libraries:
```
pip install tensorflow or pip install pytorch
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn (optional)
```

**Data:**

1. Acquire a dataset containing car features and their corresponding prices. You can find publicly available datasets online or create your own.
2. Place the dataset in the `data` directory within the project folder.

**Usage:**

1. Run the `car_price_prediction.py` script:
```
python car_price_prediction.py
```
2. The script will automatically load the data, preprocess it, train the deep learning models, evaluate their performance, and visualize the results.
3. You can modify the script to experiment with different hyperparameters, model architectures, or data preprocessing techniques.

**Output:**

* The script will print the performance metrics (MSE and R-squared) for each model.
* It will also generate visualizations depicting the relationship between car features and predicted prices.

**Further improvements:**

* Implement feature engineering techniques to extract additional features from the data.
* Explore different types of deep learning architectures for better performance.
* Fine-tune hyperparameters for optimal model accuracy.
* Implement a user interface for interactive car price prediction.

**Contributing:**

We welcome contributions to this project. You can fork the repository and submit pull requests with your improvements and suggestions.

**Disclaimer:**

This project is for educational purposes only and should not be used for real-world car price prediction without further validation and accuracy testing.
